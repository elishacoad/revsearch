# Revsearch
> *Screen references intelligently*

Started building this at the Oxford hackathon and won an award for big data in medicine!

So we decided to continue with development and continue adding features.

The goal is to have a software for researchers (but right now specifically medical) to have a modern and lightweight
but powerful platform to navigate their accumulation of research reference papers.

see live demo [here](http://revsearch.online/)!

#### Current features:

- React/Redux supported front-end single-page responsive webpage
- Upload papers from supported formats
- Mark them with your "interest level"
- Search for papers based on keywords
- Keyword highlighting

#### Future Features:
  
  - NLP based searching and sorting
  - Integration with online open-source research databases
  - Statistics progress page
  - Team colaboration
